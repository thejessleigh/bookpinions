# Requirements

This project uses Python 3.7.0 and is built in Django 2.1.7.

This project also uses pre-commit to enforce `flake8` and `black` code style. After installing the requirements from `requirements.txt`, run `pre-commit install` to get it up and running locally. Pre-commit will run on files staged for change automatically. You can also check pre-commit hook compliance on staged files by running pre-commit run at any time. Note that pre-commit ignores files that are not staged for change.
